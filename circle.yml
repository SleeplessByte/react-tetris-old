# Circle CI configuration
# https://circleci.com/docs/configuration/
#
# For quick reference:
#
# machine: adjusting the VM to your preferences and requirements
# checkout: checking out and cloning your git repo
# dependencies: setting up your projectâ€™s language-specific dependencies
# database: preparing the databases for your tests
# test: running your tests
# deployment: deploying your code to your web servers
#

##
# Save coverage as an artifact in Circle CI
#
general:
  artifacts:
    - "coverage"

##
# Ensure the current VM is on par with our deployment servers.
# - Ensure we run a specific node version
# - Ensure code climate is set up
#
machine:
  node:
    version: 6.9.1
  environment:
    CODECLIMATE_REPO_TOKEN: $CODECLIMATE_REPO_TOKEN
    PATH: "${PATH}:${HOME}/${CIRCLE_PROJECT_REPONAME}/node_modules/.bin"

##
# Cache yarn and make sure it is loaded
#
# Caching directories is not available before this step and the directory has
# to be there when this step finishes.
#
dependencies:
  cache_directories:
    - ~/.cache/yarn
  override:
    - yarn

##
# This should run all the tests for Circle CI.
#
# - yarn run clean rimrafs the old build
# - yarn run build:test:cli will do a cli build with the test env
# - yarn run test:cli runs the tests with coverage
# - yarn run coverage reports to Code Climate
#
test:
  pre:
    - yarn run clean
    - yarn run build:test:cli
  override:
    - yarn run test:cli
  post:
    - yarn run coverage

# Deploy the application to staging or production on successful (green) build.
